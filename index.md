# A packaged manual system for Windows

Welcome to Windows MAN - a new way to create, distribute and read docs for your projects and others.
The applications is being rewritten, and will include command-line and later a GUI version.

## What exactly is "packaging"?

Developers write the manpages themselves, then use a utility called **Windows MAN Packager** to put them together as one, ready to be installed by an end user by using the GUI or the **manpkg** command-line app. The creators can distribute the packages in a **repository** that can be added to a list by the user and then installed using **manpkg install**. At least, that's how it should work.

## What features do I plan to include?

* A full package manager, complete with repository support
* Rich Text Format support, to make content look way better than plain text can achieve
* A much better user interface, as well as a command line edition
* Support for AES encryption of packages
* and possibly some more stuff I can't come up with.

## How will it be structured?

The older version of Windows MAN was a Windows Forms app with all the functionality built in.
For Windows MAN X, the many features will become part of at least 2 libraries, with frontends that provide this functionality to the user.

## What about the older version?

I wrote an older version alone in 2018 and released it to my forums, which no longer exist. It runs on .NET Framework 3.5 and later.
You can get the older versions using the links below:

## The team

Well, the Windows MAN X "team" isn't really a team.
